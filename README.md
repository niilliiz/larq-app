This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a online shop for selling bottle. [livelarq](https://www.livelarq.com/) claims the credit for the designing part. it's been being only for practicing react and this has been the only purpose.

### Project Status

- Only most noticeable part of the home page and also shop page have done so far. I used firebase database to store the data. you may need vpn to see the shop page.

#### Future Changes
